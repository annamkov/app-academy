# Guessing Game Project
Our objective for this project is to build a simple game where the user has to guess a secret number that is chosen at random. Upon making a guess, the user will receive a hint indicating if their guess is too small or too large. Below is an example of how the final product will play. We've denoted the user's input with *asterisks*. All other text is produced by the computer:

    Enter number of attempts: *5*
    Enter a max number: *20*
    Enter a min number: *11*
    I'm thinking of a number between 11 and 20...
    Enter a guess: *15*
    Too high.
    Enter a guess: *11*
    Too low.
    Enter a guess: *13*
    Too high.
    Enter a guess: *12*
    Correct!
    YOU WON.
